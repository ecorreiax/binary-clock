# binary-clock

This was made only for study case.
Feel free to fork this project and mess arround with it.

Currently using Vue 2.x. It's kinda a single page web application, I'm not using Vuex, Vue Router or any stuff like that
The only reason to do this whole project, was try to do somethin tha envolves binaries.

Peace up :v:
